A Mixed Reality based Diagnosis for Patient  Centric Healthcare 

## Abstract
MRI has a significant need in the healthcare industry, the cross-sectional images of the body provide 
insight of the problems or abnormalities in the patients. A detailed report is written by the radiologist 
referring to these scans. There are often errors introduced in this process, due to the inflexibility of two
dimensional images. The radiologists may misinterpret the dimensions and location of tumors in 3D 
space leading to errors that complicate the existing patient situation. There are also errors observed 
during surgeries causing risk to the patient's life. Surgical errors include unwanted incisions and 
complicated approaches for the interested site disturbing the sensitive nerves and tissues. These errors 
are minimized by developing a tool,  aiding diagnosis and surgeries using custom-built highly accurate 
deep learning models for identifying the tumors and projecting using Augmented Reality (AR). The 
tool projects the 3D model of the brain and tumor reconstructed from MRI scans using mobile phone 
augmenting to the real world via camera. This tool helps resolve the errors occurring during surgeries 
and promotes faster recovery time for patients due to better pre-surgery planning and reducing sensitive 
nerves and tissue mobilization, and helps radiologists provide faster and more accurate diagnosis results 
using state-of-the-art technology.
